## Supported Architectures

We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list).

Simply pulling `ghcr.io/hydazz/amp:ubuntu` should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Available | Tag |
| :----: | :----: | ---- |
| x86-64 | ✅ | amd64-\<version tag\> |
| arm64 | ❌ | |
| armhf| ❌ | |

## Version Tags

This image provides various versions that are available via tags. Please read the descriptions carefully and exercise caution when using unstable or development tags.

| Tag | Available | Description |
| :----: | :----: |--- |
| latest | ✅ | alpine image with glibc, tiny image but only java servers will work! |
| ubuntu | ✅ | ubuntu image (limited to java servers at this time) |

## Application Setup

As it takes more than 10 seconds (the default timeout for Docker) for AMP to do a graceful shutdown, make sure you have no running modules. Stopping your container via Docker while you have running modules may cause corruption as Docker will kill the container.

**Java is not installed by default, see [here](where?) for more information**

## Supported Modules

**Will Work:**

- Java applications such as Minecraft Java, Minecraft Bedrock + others

**Won't Work:**

- [Everything Else](https://github.com/CubeCoders/AMP/wiki/Supported-Applications-Compatibility)

## MAC Address (Important)

AMP is designed to detect hardware changes and will de-activate all instances when something significant changes. This is to stop people from sharing pre-activated instances and bypassing the licencing server. One way of detecting changes is to look at the MAC address of the host's network card. A change here will de-activate instances.

By default, Docker assigns a new MAC address to a container every time it is restarted. Therefore, unless you want to painstakingly re-activate all your instances on every server reboot, you need to assign a permanent MAC address.

For most people, this can be accomplished by generating a random MAC address in Docker's acceptable range. The instructions to do so are as follows:

- Visit this page: https://miniwebtool.com/mac-address-generator/
- Put `02:42:AC` in as the prefix
- Choose the format with colons `:`
- Generate

- Copy the generated MAC and use it when starting the container.

  - For `docker run`, use the following flag: (Substitute your generated MAC)

    `--mac-address="02:42:AC:XX:XX:XX"`

  - For Docker Compose, use the following key next to `image`:

    `mac_address: 02:42:AC:XX:XX:XX`

If you have a unique network situation, a random MAC may not work for you. In that case you will need to come up with your own solution to prevent address conflicts.

If you need help with any of this, please make an issue.

## Ports

Here's a rough (and potentially incorrect) list of default ports for the various modules. Each module also exposes port 8080 for the Web UI (can be changed with environment variables). If you find an inaccuracy, open an issue!

| Module Name | Default Ports                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `ADS`       | No additional ports.                    |
| `McMyAdmin` | TCP 25565                               |
| `Minecraft` | TCP 25565 (Java) or UDP 19132 (Bedrock) |

Just a quick note about ports: some games use TCP, some games use UDP. Make sure you are using the right protocol. Don't fall into the trap of accidentally mapping a TCP port for a UDP game -- you won't be able to connect.

## Environment Variables

###  Java Versions

| Name | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `JAVA_VERSIONS` | Set this to the java versions you need, java is not installed by default and must be set here. Supported java versions range from 7-17, you can have multiple versions specified, seperated by a comma. Example: `7,9,13`... | `None` |

### Module

| Name     | Description                                                      | Default Value |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `MODULE` | Which Module to use for the main instance created by this image. | `ADS`         |

To run multiple game servers under this image, use the default value of `ADS` (Application Deployment Service) which allows you to create various modules from the web ui.

To be clear, this Docker image creates ONE instance by default. If you want to create more, use `ADS` as the first instance, and create the rest with the web UI. Otherwise, you can pick any other module from the list.

Here are the accepted values for the `MODULE` variable:

| Module Name | Description                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ADS`       | Application Deployment Service. Used to manage multiple modules. Need multiple game servers? Pick this.       |
| `McMyAdmin` | If you have a McMyAdmin Licence, this will be picked for you no matter what. It is equivalent to `Minecraft`. |
| `Minecraft` | Includes Java (Spigot, Bukkit, Paper, etc.) and Bedrock servers.                                              |

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker-compose

```yaml
---
version: "2.1"
services:
  amp:
    image: ghcr.io/hydazz/amp:ubuntu
    container_name: amp
    mac_address: 00:00:00:00:00:00
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
      - USERNAME=admin
      - PASSWORD=admin
      - LICENCE=000-000-000-000
      - JAVA_VERSIONS=7,9,13 #optional
      - MODULE=ADS #optional
    volumes:
      - <path to data>:/config
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
      - 25565:25565 #optional
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### docker cli ([click here for more info](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/))

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=amp \
  --mac-address=00:00:00:00:00:00 \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -e USERNAME=admin \
  -e PASSWORD=admin \
  -e LICENCE=000-000-000-000 \
  -e JAVA_VERSIONS=7,9,13 `#optional` \
  -e MODULE=ADS `#optional` \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 25565:25565 `#optional` \
  -v <path to data>:/config \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/hydazz/amp:ubuntu
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `--mac-address=` | Set the mac_address for the license check. |
| `-p 8080` | WebUI Port |
| `-p 25565` | placeholder minecraft port (add more as required) |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use, eg. Europe/London |
| `-e USERNAME=admin` | Specify a username for the webUI |
| `-e PASSWORD=admin` | Specify a password for the webUI |
| `-e LICENCE=000-000-000-000` | Specify a valid license for AMP |
| `-e JAVA_VERSIONS=7,9,13` | you can have multiple versions specified seperated by a comma |
| `-e MODULE=ADS` | Which Module to use for the main instance created by this image |
| `-v /config` | Appdata Path |


## Umask for running applications

For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional `-e UMASK=022` setting.
Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) before asking for support.

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```bash
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```

## Updating Info

Most of our images are static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app inside. With some exceptions (ie. nextcloud, plex), we do not recommend or support updating apps inside the container. Please consult the [Application Setup](#application-setup) section above to see if it is recommended for the image.

Below are the instructions for updating containers:

### Via Docker Compose

* Update all images: `docker-compose pull`
  * or update a single image: `docker-compose pull amp`
* Let compose update all containers as necessary: `docker-compose up -d`
  * or update a single container: `docker-compose up -d amp`
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Docker Run

* Update the image: `docker pull ghcr.io/hydazz/amp:ubuntu`
* Stop the running container: `docker stop amp`
* Delete the container: `docker rm amp`
* Recreate a new container with the same docker run parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your `/config` folder and settings will be preserved)
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

## Building locally

If you want to make local modifications to these images for development purposes or just to customize the logic:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hydazz/docker-amp.git
cd docker-amp
docker build \
  --no-cache \
  --pull \
  -t ghcr.io/hydazz/amp:ubuntu .
```

The ARM variants can be built on x86_64 hardware using `multiarch/qemu-user-static`

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
```

Once registered you can define the dockerfile to use with `-f Dockerfile.aarch64`.
